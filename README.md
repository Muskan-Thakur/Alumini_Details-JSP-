This Java NetBeans project is a dictionary application designed to provide users with word meanings, antonyms, and synonyms. The application allows users to add new words along with their respective meanings, antonyms, and synonyms.

Users can utilize the search functionality to look up specific words and retrieve their meanings. The application ensures that all fields are filled, preventing any empty fields, and enforces the requirement of providing meaning, antonyms, and synonyms for each word entry.
