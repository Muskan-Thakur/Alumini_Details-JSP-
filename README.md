This Java NetBeans project is a dictionary application designed to provide users with word meanings, antonyms, and synonyms. The application allows users to add new words along with their respective meanings, antonyms, and synonyms.

Users can utilize the search functionality to look up specific words and retrieve their meanings. The application ensures that all fields are filled, preventing any empty fields, and enforces the requirement of providing meaning, antonyms, and synonyms for each word entry.

Search Button Functionality :
The search button allows users to search for a specific word in the database.
When the user enters a word in the search field and clicks the search button, the application will retrieve the meaning, antonyms, and synonyms associated with that word from the database.
If the word exists in the database, the application will display its details.
However, if the word is not found in the database, a message will appear indicating that the word does not exist.

Reset Button Functionality:

The reset button provides users with the option to clear all the fields in the application.
When the reset button is clicked, all the text fields for word, meaning, antonyms, and synonyms will be set to null, effectively clearing any previously entered data.
This allows users to start fresh and enter new word entries without any pre-existing values.
